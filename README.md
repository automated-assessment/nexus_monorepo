Welcome to the Peer Feedback Tool Readme

The tool was developed using MongoDB, express.js, AngularJS and Node.js.

Please ensure that you have MongoDB and Nodejs installed and running, then put your configuration details in .env. When you’re ready, start the application by opening run.command.

https://docs.mongodb.com/getting-started/shell/installation/
https://nodejs.org/en/

The tool will run on your localhost and port 3050. 

Unfortunately, `run.command’ may require permission to execute - this is unavoidable. Please follow the instructions for your operating system on how to grant permissions to the file.

The executable is a bash script and may therefore not run on certain machines.

Therefore, please run:
npm install
node server.js

From within the PeerFeedback folder.

For further information about the tool please see the report.
For information on getting the tool set up, please see the user guide.

Thank you
