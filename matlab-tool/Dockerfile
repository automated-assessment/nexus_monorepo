# These expect you to define some local information:
# - your matlab installation on the Docker host, perhaps `/usr/local/MATLAB/R2016a`. Mount this volume as per below.
# - optional path on the Docker host to receive Matlab logs, perhaps `~/matlab-logs`. Not currently supported.
# - MAC address associated with your own Matlab License, of the form `00:00:00:00:00:00`. Spoof this when creating the Docker
#    container.
