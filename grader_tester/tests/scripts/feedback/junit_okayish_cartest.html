When the car takes a pit stop, this makes the car go slower in this lap by the amount of seconds specified in pitStopTime.

Otherwise, the car goes faster in this lap by the amount of seconds specified by lowFuelBoost.: High fuel slowdown has not been taken into account correctly expected:<75> but was:<76></li></ol></div></div>
