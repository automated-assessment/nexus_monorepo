<h2>Repushing to GHE</h2>

<p>Below, select the range of submissions to be pushed out to GHE again. Note
   that this will only push these submissions to GHE; it will not run any of
   the marking tools.</p>

<div class="alert alert-danger">
  <p>
    <strong>Only use this function if you know what you are doing!</strong>
    Most submission processing errors can be fixed using the reprocessing or
    remarking features. The functionality here should only be used if there has
    been data loss in GHE.
  </p>

  <p>Before using this functionality, make sure:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>The original upload files are still on the nexus server and have been
      unpacked to the correct directory in <code>var/submissions/code</code></li>
    <li>If there are other submissions to this assignment from the same user
      that Nexus has marked as having been successful already and that you are
      <strong>not</strong> submitting for repushing, then there is a corresponding
      branch for this user and assignment on GHE. This branch should be in
      <%= link_to(@assignment.repourl, @assignment.repourl)%>.</li>
    <li>If you <strong>are</strong> submitting all submissions by a user for
      repushing, then there must not be a corresponding branch for this user
      and assignment on GHE in the repository at
      <%= link_to(@assignment.repourl, @assignment.repourl)%>.</li>
  </ol>
</div>
