  <p>When submitting through Git, you agree to the following:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>The specific commit you have indicated will constitute your submission
      for marking purposes. It is your responsibility to ensure that the data
      you submit (including the Git URL, the branch name, and the commit SHA)
      are correct and do not contain any typos.</li>
    <li>It is your responsibility to ensure that your submission remains accessible
      to the marking system and to teaching staff at any time. The easiest way
      to do so is to (a) provide submissions from a King's Github Enterprise
      repository only, and (b) not remove the repository until the marks have
      been ratified by the College Exam Board. If the repository becomes
      inaccessible to the marking system at any point (except through a technical
      failure of Github Enterprise), you are likely to receive a mark of zero
      for your submission.</li>
    <li>Attempts to alter the Git history for your submission or indeed the
      submission itself constitute misconduct according to the B3 Misconduct
      Regulations. Any suspected cases of this will be dealt with according to
      the university's misconduct procedure. Upheld charges can result in a range
      of penalties from an award of zero marks for the work, to expulsion from the
      college.</li>
  </ol>
